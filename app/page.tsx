              Bachata was born in the early 1960s in the poor neighborhoods of
              the Dominican Republic. For decades it was dismissed as{" "}
              <em>música de amargue</em> — music of bitterness — too raw, too
              working-class to be played on the radio. It was banned. Looked
              down upon. Almost forgotten.
            </p>
            <p>
              It survived anyway. Because when music speaks directly to the
              heart, no amount of gatekeeping can silence it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today Bachata is danced on every continent — from open-air
              festivals in Barcelona to rooftop socials in Tokyo. It has evolved
              into something extraordinary: a conversation between two people,
              told through movement, built on trust, carried by music that makes
              you feel everything at once.

              You don&apos;t need rhythm. You don&apos;t need a partner. You
              don&apos;t need to feel &ldquo;ready.&rdquo; You just need to show
              up once — and let the music do the rest.

              People who try Bachata rarely stop. Not because they have to. But
              because it becomes the best part of their week — the place where
              stress melts, strangers become lifelong friends, and you remember
              that your body was built for far more than sitting at a desk.

              You&apos;ll leave your first class with a smile you can&apos;t
              explain, the number of at least three new people in your phone,
              and a very strong urge to come back next week.
